## Description

An application that illustrates the efficacy of different curve fitting and interpolation models
---

## Features

Curve Fitting And Interpolation: 

- Open and display an arbitrary signal
- Choose the order of the fitting polynomial 
- The fitted equation and percentage error are shown in its mathematical form above the main graph
- Can generate an error map for the fitting process 
- Choose the x- and y- axis of the error map among number of chunks, order of the fitting polynomial, and overlapping between consecutive chunks 
- The error values in the map been normalized 
- The extrapolation efficacy, there is been an option to clip the curve fitting process into only portion of the open signal
